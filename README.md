# 🌠 Raven Stars System Simulator

**Raven Stars System Simulator** is a comprehensive framework for modeling, testing, and visualizing the “star‐drawing” consensus and symbolic harmony of a custom blockchain ecosystem.  
It bundles:

- A **StarNode** network with dynamic scoring, quarantine & reward logic  
- A **Prophet** module to analyze inter‐node interactions as harmonic signals  
- An **UnstoppableCoreAlgorithm** that mines “star paths” on a directed graph  
- A **SystemSimulator** that executes fault‐injection scenarios, environmental stresses, and firewall-based stabilizations  
- A **dynamic suspension** mechanism (pause/resume) for long-running loops

## 🚀 Features

- 🔹 **StarNode**  
  • Node state management (0, 1, SILENCE)  
  • Path history, response times, position & alignment  
  • Scoring, quarantine & reward assignment  

- 🔹 **Prophet**  
  • Collects and combines adjacent node states  
  • Generates composite harmonic waveforms  

- 🔹 **UnstoppableCoreAlgorithm**  
  • Builds an n-node directed graph for “star path” consensus  
  • Configurable proof-of-work challenges (low/medium/high risk)  
  • Dynamic environment factors (liquid volume, air turbulence)  

- 🔹 **SystemSimulator**  
  • Initialize node network (internal/external)  
  • Inject faults, adjust resources, run firewall stabilization  
  • Plot time-domain and frequency-domain harmonic signals  
  • Update node quarantine/reward status  
  • Visualize star sequences  

- 🔹 **Dynamic Suspension**  
  • `pause_execution()` / `resume_execution()` control with `threading.Event`  
  • Integrated `pause_event.wait()` in critical loops  
  • Safely pause & resume mining, simulation steps, and stabilization cycles
